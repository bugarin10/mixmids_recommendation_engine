# Motivation

Our moto is the impact we can make in alleviating choice overload. This phenomenon, characterized by the overwhelming stress and indecision caused by an abundance of options, is a challenge many face daily. By developing a recommendation engine, we aim to empower individuals with personalized suggestions, reducing the cognitive load associated with decision-making and increasing satisfaction with chosen options. Let's drink and think in the conversation not on what to drink!
